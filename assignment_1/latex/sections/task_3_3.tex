\section{Task 3.3}

Create two modules that realize a producer and a consumer thread. The modules should be connected together using a \textbf{sc\_fifo} channel. Use the structure of a TCP package to simulate the data transmitted over the transmission (fifo) channel. The producer transmits a new TCP package with a random interval between 2-10 ms. The consumer thread must print the simulation time and sequence number each time a new TCP package is received. Use the TCP Header structure as described below with a total package size of 512 bytes. Inspiration can be found in the \textbf{FifoFilter} (Fork.h, when adding two consumers) example project.

Extend your model to have two fifo channels and consumers receiving TCP packes on port 1 and 2. The producer must be rewritten to connect to more ports.
