\section{Task 3.5}

Implement a model that demonstrates a system design that transfer data at the TLM level refined to BCAM level. Use the \texttt{sc\_fifo} to model communication at the TLM level and refine it to BCAM using adapters. As inspiration study the example project \textbf{SmartPitchDetector}. Here a master sends data to a slave using a \texttt{sc\_fifo} and an adpater that converts to the bus cycle accurate interface on the receiving slave. Use the model from task 3.4 for the interface at the Avalon-ST sink interface for the slave as illustrated below.
