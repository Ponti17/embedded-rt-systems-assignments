\section{Task 3.4}

Create a cycle accurate communication model of a master and slave module that uses the Avalon Streaming Bus Interface (ST). Simulate that a master are transmitting data to a slave module as illustrated in Figure (\ref{fig:avalon}). The slave should store received data from the master in a text file. Include in the model a situation where the data sink signals $\text{ready} = \text{'0'}$. The simulated result should be presented in the GTK wave viewer, so a VCD trace file must be created. It should e possible to configure the channel, error and data size define in a separate header file.
